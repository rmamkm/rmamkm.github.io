				<p class="col-sm-8">Railroad and railroad technology will always be seen as one of the primary factors to Union success in the Civil War. In 1861 the U.S. had over 22,000 miles of rail in northern territory, compared to just over 9,000 in southern territory. While the Union continued to invest in railroads, the Confederate States saw their lines deteriorate. The Union was able to utilize their railroad to move equipment and supplies to troops much quicker. As a result, they were better able to sustain warfare. The Union was keen on this advantage and even created rail battery cars to bring heavy artillery in quickly to key battlefields.</p>

				</div>
				<p class="col-sm-8 col-sm-pull-4">The Civil War was pivotal to naval technology. Wooden warships were the norm prior to 1861, but iron-clad steam powered  vessels were first used in the Civil War. Similarly, the first warfare submarines were built during this time, and the Confederate H.L. Hunley has the distinction of being the first submarine to sink a warship. The Hunley utilized a crank propeller and was armed with a torpedo mounted to a boom.  By ramming the U.S.S. Housatonic, it was able to detonate the torpedo and sink the one of the Unionâ€™s most storied vessels.</p>

				<p class="col-sm-8">The Civil War is responsible for many innovative weapons that are precursors to modern day weapons. One such weapon is the Gatling gun. Known as the predecessor to the machine gun, it was was first used by the Union Army in 1862 and revolutionized weapon standards. The first Gatling gun was crank operated and was capable of firing 200 rounds in under a minute.</p>

     <p>The use of technology had a significant impact on the Union victory over the Confederate Army. While both sides innovated and made lasting contributions to military technology and medicine, some of the more fundamental advances were in transportation.</p>
     <p>The Union, with greater resources and a dedication by its <a href="leadership.html">leadership</a> to develop rail and railroad transportation, benefitted the most. Better rail technology meant that the Union Army was better able support and replenish its troops. A vital factor in any war.</p>
